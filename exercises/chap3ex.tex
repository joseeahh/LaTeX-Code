\section{Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms}

\subsection{Definitions and Examples}

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups.

\begin{problems}
    \item Let $\phi : G \to H$ be a homomorphism and let $E$ be a subgroup of $H$. Prove that $\phi\inv(E) \leq G$ (i.e., the preimage or pullback of a subgroup under a homomorphism is a subgroup). If $E \nsub H$ prove that $\phi\inv(E) \nsub G$. Deduce that $\ker(\phi) \nsub G$.
    \begin{sol}
        Since $E \leq H$, then $1_H \in E$. Since $\phi(1_G) = 1_H \in E$, then $1_G \in \phi\inv(E)$ so that it is nonempty. Suppose $x, y \in \phi\inv(E)$. Then $\phi(x), \phi(y) \in E$ so that $\phi(x)\phi(y)\inv = \phi(xy\inv) \in E$. Then $xy\inv \in \phi\inv(E)$, hence $\phi\inv(E) \leq G$.
        
        If $E \nsub H$, then $heh\inv \in E$ for every $e \in E$ and $h \in H$. Let $x \in \phi\inv(E)$ and $g \in G$. Note that $\phi(g) \in H$. Then
        \[\phi(g)\phi(x)\phi(g)\inv = \phi(gxg\inv) \in E\]
        so that $gxg\inv \in \phi\inv(E)$. Then $\phi\inv(E) \nsub G$, and since $\ker(\phi) = \phi\inv(1_H)$, then $\ker(\phi) \nsub G$ as well.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $\varphi : G \to H$ be a homomorphism of groups with kernel $K$ and let $a,b \in \varphi(G)$. Let $X \in G/K$ be the fiber above $a$ and let $Y$ be the fiber above $b$, i.e.,
    $X = \varphi^{-1}(a)$, $Y = \varphi^{-1}(b)$. Fix an element $u \in X$ (so $\varphi(u)=a$). Prove that if $XY = Z$ in the quotient group $G/K$ and $w$ is any member of $Z$, then there is some $v \in Y$ such that $uv = w$. [Show $u^{-1}w \in Y$.]
    \begin{sol}
        To show that $v = u\inv w \in Y$, then
        \[\phi(v) = \phi(u\inv w) = \phi(u)\inv \phi(w) = a\inv (ab) = b \in Y \qh\]
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $A$ be an abelian group and let $B$ be a subgroup of $A$.
    Prove that $A/B$ is abelian. Give an example of a non-abelian group $G$ containing a proper normal subgroup $N$ such that $G/N$ is abelian.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $aB, a'B \in A/B$. Then
        \[(aB)(a'B) = (aa')B = (a'a)B = (a'B)(aB)\]
        so that $A/B$ is abelian.

        To produce an abelian quotient group from a non-abelian group, a good thought is to consider the centers of non-abelian groups. In this case, we may choose $G = D_8$ with $Z(D_8) = \gen{r^2} \nsub D_8$. Since $D_8/\gen{r^2} \cong V_4$, then the quotient group is abelian.
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove that in the quotient group $G/N$, $(gN)^{\alpha} = g^{\alpha}N$ for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}$.
    \begin{sol}
        Note that $(gN)^0 = 1N = g^0N$, and $(gN)\inv = g\inv N$ by Proposition 3.5. It suffices to show that the relationship holds for $\alpha \in \zp$. To that end, note that $\alpha = 1$ holds. Supposing it holds for some $\alpha$, then
        \[(gN)^{\alpha + 1} = (gN)^\alpha (gN) = (g^\alpha N)(gN) = g^{\alpha + 1}N\]
        so that the result is true by induction.
    \end{sol}
    \item Use the preceding exercise to prove that the order of the element $gN$ in $G/N$ is $n$, where $n$ is the smallest positive integer such that $g^n \in N$ (and $gN$ has infinite order if no such positive integer exists). Give an example to show that the order of $gN$ in $G/N$ may be strictly smaller than the order of $g$ in $G$.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $gN \in G/N$. If possible, let $n \in \zp$ be the smallest integer such that $g^n \in N$. Then $g^nN = (gN)^n = 1N$ so that $|gN| \leq n$. Moreover, if $m \in \zp$ is an integer such that $(gN)^m = 1N$, then $g^mN = 1N$ so that $g^m \in N$. By minimality of $n$, then $|gN| \geq n$ so that $|gN| = n$.

        If there is no such $n$, then $g^k \not\in N$ for every $k \in \zp$. Suppose for contradiction that $gN$ has infinite order $x$. Then $(gN)^x = g^xN = 1N$, or that $g^x \in N$, contradicting our previous assumption. It follows that $gN$ has infinite order. Moreover, let $G$ be a nontrivial group with nonidentity $g \in G$. Noting that $G \nsub G$, then $gG \in G/N$ has order 1, but $\abs g > 1$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Define $\varphi : \mathbb{R}^{\times} \to \{\pm 1\}$ by letting $\varphi(x)$ be $x$ divided by the absolute value of $x$. Describe the fibers of $\varphi$ and prove that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism.
    \begin{sol}
        The fibers of $\phi$ are as follows: the positive reals map to 1, and the negative reals map to $-1$. Moreover, for any $x, y \in \r\unt$, then
        \[\phi(xy) = \frac{xy}{\abs{xy}} = \frac{x}{\abs x} \cdot \frac{y}{\abs y} = \phi(x)\phi(y) \qh\]
    \end{sol}
    \item Define $\pi : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\pi((x,y)) = x + y$. Prove that $\pi$ is a surjective homomorphism and describe the kernel and fibers of $\pi$ geometrically.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $(x, y), (a, b) \in \r^2$. Then
        \begin{align*}
            \pi((x, y) + (a, b)) & = \pi((x + a, y + b)) \\
            & = (x + a) + (y + b) \\
            & = (x + y) + (a + b) \\
            & = \pi((x, y)) + \pi((a, b))
        \end{align*}
        so that $\pi$ is a homomorphism. Moreover, for any $a \in \r$, then $\pi((a, 0)) = a$ so that $\pi$ is surjective. $\ker(\pi)$ is the diagonal line in $\r$ with equation $y = -x$, and the fiber $\phi\inv(a)$ for any $a \in \r$ is the diagonal line $y = -x + a$, or just a vertical translation of the kernel.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $\varphi : \mathbb{R}^{\times} \to \mathbb{R}^{\times}$ be the map sending $x$ to the absolute value of $x$. Prove that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism and find the image of $\varphi$. Describe the kernel and the fibers of $\varphi$.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $x, y \in \r\unt$. Then
        \[\phi(xy) = |xy| = |x||y| = \phi(x)\pi(y)\]
        so that $\phi$ is a homomorphism. Moreover, $\phi(\pm a) = a$ for any $a \in \r^+$ so that $\im(\phi)$ is the positive reals. $\ker(\phi) = \set{1, -1}$ since no other real number has an absolute value of 1, and the fiber of $\phi$ over $a$ is the pair of reals $\{a, -a\}$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Define $\varphi : \mathbb{C}^{\times} \to \mathbb{R}^{\times}$ by $\varphi(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2$. Prove that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism and find the image of $\varphi$. Describe the kernel and the fibers of $\varphi$ geometrically (as subsets of the plane).
    \begin{sol}
        Let $a + bi, c + di \in \c\unt$. Then
        \begin{align*}
            \phi((a + bi)(c + di)) & = \phi((ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i) \\
            & = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2 \\
            & = a^2c^2 - 2abcd + b^2d^2 + a^2d^2 + 2abcd + b^2c^2 \\
            & = c^2(a^2 + b^2) + d^2(a^2 + b^2) \\
            & = (a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \\
            & = \phi(a + bi)\phi(c + di)
        \end{align*}
        and $\phi$ is a homomorphism. Note that $a^2 + b^2 > 0$ for any $a, b$ where at least one of them is nonzero, so $\im(\phi) \subseteq \r^+$. Also, $\phi(\sqrt a + 0i) = a$ for any $a \in \r^+$, so $\im(\phi) = \r^+$. $\ker(\phi) = \{a + bi \in \c\unt \mid a^2 + b^2 = 1\}$ is simply the circle of radius 1, and the fiber of $\phi$ over some $a \in \r\unt$ is the circle with radius $\sqrt a$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $\phi : \intmod[8] \to \intmod[4]$ by $\phi(\bar  a) = \bar  a$. Show that this is a well defined, surjective homomorphism and describe its fibers and kernel explicitly (showing that $\phi$ is well defined involves the fact that $\bar  a$ has a different meaning in the domain and range of $\phi$).
    \begin{sol}
        Suppose $\bar  a = \bar  b$ for $\bar  a, \bar  b \in \intmod[8]$. Then $a = b + 8k$ for $k \in \z$, and
        \[\phi(\bar  a) = \bar  a = \bar{b + 8k} = \bar{b + 4(2k)} = \bar  b = \phi(\bar  b)\]
        Moreover, this is a homomorphism as
        \[\phi(\bar  a + \bar  b) = \phi(\bar{a + b}) = \bar{a + b} = \bar  a + \bar  b = \phi(\bar  a) + \phi(\bar  b)\]
        and is clearly surjective as $\phi(\bar  a) = \bar  a$ for any $\bar  a \in \intmod[4]$. The fibers are the following, noting that $\ker(\phi) = \phi\inv(\bar  0)$:
        \begin{align*}
            \phi\inv(\bar  0) & = \set{\bar  0, \bar  4} \\
            \phi\inv(\bar  1) & = \set{\bar  1, \bar  5} \\
            \phi\inv(\bar  2) & = \set{\bar  2, \bar  6} \\
            \phi\inv(\bar  3) & = \set{\bar  3, \bar  7} \qh
        \end{align*}
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $F$ be a field and let
    \[G = \set*{\left.
    \begin{pmatrix}
        a & b \\
        0 & c 
    \end{pmatrix}~\right|~a, b, c \in F, ac \neq 0} \leq \gl_2(F)\]
    \begin{problems}
        \item Prove that the map
        \[\phi : 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            a & b \\
            0 & c
        \end{pmatrix} \mapsto a\]
        is a surjective homomorphism from $G$ onto $F\unt$ (recall that $F\unt$ is the multiplicative group of nonzero elements in $F$). Describe the fibers and kernel of $\phi$.
        \item Prove that the map
        \[\psi : 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            a & b \\
            0 & c
        \end{pmatrix} \mapsto (a, c)\]
        is a surjective homomorphism from $G$ onto $F\unt \times F\unt$. Describe the fibers and kernel of $\psi$. 
        \item Let
        \[H = \set*{\left .
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & b \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix} ~\right\vert~b \in F}\]
        Prove that $H$ is isomorphic to the additive group $F$.
    \end{problems}
    \begin{solalph}
        \item Note that
        \[\phi\left(
        \begin{pmatrix}
            a & 1 \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}\right) = a\]
        so that $\phi$ is surjective. Moreover, for any $a, b, c, d, e, f \in F$ with $ac \neq 0$ and $df \neq 0$, we have
        \[\phi\left(
        \begin{pmatrix}
            a & b \\
            0 & c
        \end{pmatrix}
        \begin{pmatrix}
            d & e \\
            0 & f
        \end{pmatrix}\right) = 
        \phi\left(
        \begin{pmatrix}
            ad & ae + bf \\
            0 & cf
        \end{pmatrix}\right) = ad = 
        \phi\left(
        \begin{pmatrix}
            a & b \\
            0 & c
        \end{pmatrix}\right)
        \phi\left(
        \begin{pmatrix}
            d & e \\
            0 & f
        \end{pmatrix}\right)\]
        and $\phi$ is then a homomorphism. The fiber of $a \in F\unt$ over $\phi$ is
        \[\phi\inv(a) = 
        \set*{\left.
        \begin{pmatrix}
            a & s \\
            0 & t
        \end{pmatrix}~\right|~s, t \in F, t \neq 0}\]
        with $\ker(\phi) = \phi\inv(1)$.
        \item Showing that $\psi$ is a surjective homomorphism is very similar to the previous part. The fiber of any $(a, c) \in F\unt \times F\unt$ is
        \[\psi\inv((a, c)) = 
        \set*{\left.
        \begin{pmatrix}
            a & s \\
            0 & c
        \end{pmatrix}~\right|~s \in F}\]
        with $\ker(\psi) = \psi\inv((1, 1))$.
        \item Define the mapping $\pi : H \to F$ given by
        \[\pi\left(
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & b \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}\right) = b\]
        Then its inverse $\pi\inv : F \to H$ given by
        \[\pi\inv(b) = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & b \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}\]
        is a two-sided inverse of $\pi$ so that $\pi$ is a bijection. Moreover, for $b, c \in F$, then
        \[\pi\left(
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & b \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & c \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}\right) = 
        \pi\left(
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & b + c \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}\right) = b + c = 
        \pi\left(
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & b \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}\right) + 
        \pi\left(
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & c \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}\right)\]
        so that $\pi$ is a homomorphism. Then $\pi$ is an isomorphism, and $H \cong F$.
    \end{solalph}
    \item Let $G$ be the additive group of real numbers, let $H$ be the multiplicative group of complex numbers of absolute value $1$ (the unit circle $S^1$ in the complex plane) and let $\varphi : G \to H$ be the homomorphism $\varphi : r \mapsto e^{2\pi i r}$. Draw the points on a real line which lie in the kernel of $\varphi$. Describe similarly the elements in the fibers of $\varphi$ above the points $-1$, $i$, and $e^{4\pi i/3}$ of $H$.
    \begin{sol}
        Since $e^{2\pi ir} = 1$ if and only if $r$ is an integer, then $\ker(\phi) = \z$. On a number line, this is shown as
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \draw[<->] (-4.5, 0) -- (4.5, 0);
    
                \foreach \x in {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
                    \fill (\x, 0) circle (1.5pt);

                \foreach \x in {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
                    \node at (\x, -0.3) {$\x$};
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        Moreover, note that $-1 = e^{-2\pi i/2}$ and $i = e^{2\pi i/4}$. Then the fibers of these elements are just the integral differences of $1/2, 1/4$, and $2/3$ respectively, since $4\pi i/3 = 2/3(2\pi i)$:
        \begin{align*}
            \phi\inv(-1) & = \frac 12 + \z = \set*{\left.\frac 12 + n~\right|~n \in \z} \\
            \phi\inv(i) & = \frac 14 + \z = \set*{\left.\frac 14 + n~\right|~n \in \z} \\
            \phi\inv(e^{4\pi i/3}) & = \frac 23 + \z = \set*{\left.\frac 23 + n~\right|~n \in \z} \qh
        \end{align*}
    \end{sol}
    \item Repeat the preceding exercise with the map $\varphi$ replaced by the map $\varphi : r \mapsto e^{4\pi i r}$.
    \begin{sol}
        The kernel of $\phi$ is $\frac12\z$, or
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \draw[<->] (-4.5, 0) -- (4.5, 0);
    
                \foreach \x in {-4, -3.5, -3, -2.5, -2, -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4}
                    \fill (\x, 0) circle (1.5pt);

                \foreach \x in {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
                    \node at (\x, -0.3) {$\x$};
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        Moreover, the fibers are just all halved, so
        \begin{align*}
            \phi\inv(-1) & = \frac14 + \frac12 \z = \set*{\left.\frac14 + \frac n2~\right|~n \in \z} \\
            \phi\inv(-i) & = \frac18 + \frac12 \z = \set*{\left.\frac18 + \frac n2~\right|~n \in \z} \\
            \phi\inv(e^{4\pi i/3}) & = \frac13 + \frac12 \z = \set*{\left.\frac13 + \frac n2~\right|~n \in \z} \qh
        \end{align*}
    \end{sol}
    \item Consider the additive quotient group $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$.
    \begin{problems}
        \item Show that every coset of $\mathbb{Z}$ in $\mathbb{Q}$ contains exactly one representative $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ in the range $0 \le q < 1$.
        \item Show that every element of $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ has finite order but that there are elements of arbitrarily large order.
        \item Show that $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is the torsion subgroup of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ (cf.\ Exercise 6, Section 2.1).
        \item Prove that $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of roots of unity in $\mathbb{C}^\times$.
    \end{problems}
    \begin{solalph}
        \item Suppose $t \in \q$, and put $t = a/b$ in lowest terms. Then there exists unique $q, r$ such that $a = bq + r$, or that $t = q + r/b$, where $0 \leq r < 1$. Then $t + \z = q + r/b + \z = r/b + \z$. Since $r$ is unique, then $r/b$ is the representative of $t + \z$ such that $0 \leq r < 1$.
        \item Suppose $t = p/q \in \q$. Then $|t + \z| \leq q$, since $q(t + \z) = qt + \z = \z$ so that $t + \z$ has finite order. Moreover, $1/k + \z \in \q/\z$ has order $k$, but because $k \in \z$ can be made arbitrarily large, then $1/k + \z$ has arbitrarily large order.
        \item Note that $\q/\z \subseteq \tor(\r/\z)$ by the previous exercise, so it remains to show that cosets with irrational representatives do not have finite order. If $x + \z \in \r/\z$ with finite order $n$, and $x \in \r - \q$, then $n(x + \z) = nx + \z = \z$ implies that $nx \in \z$. But since $n \in \zp$, this implies that $x \in \z$, contradicting that it was irrational. Hence, $\tor(\r/\z) = \q/\z$.
        \item By Exercise 3.1.12, we have $\r/\z \cong S^1$. Note that $\tor(S^1)$ consists of $z \in \c\unt$ such that $z^n = 1$, which is precisely the set of roots of unity. Since $\tor(\r/\z) = \q/\z$, then $\q/\z$ is isomorphic to the set of roots of unity.
    \end{solalph}
    \item \label{ex3.1.15} Prove that a quotient of a divisible abelian group by any proper subgroup is also divisible. Deduce that $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is divisible (cf. \hyperref[ex2.4.19]{Exercise 2.4.19}).
    \begin{sol}
        Let $A$ be a divisible abelian group, and let $B$ be a proper subgroup of $A$. Pick $aB \in A/B$. Since $A$ is divisible, there exists $x \in A$ such that $x^n = a$ for $x \in A$ and $n \in \z$. Then $(xB)^n = x^nB = aB$ so that $A/B$ is divisible. Since $\q$ is divisible, and $\z < \q$ is proper, then $\q/\z$ is also divisible.

    \item Let $G$ be a group, let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$, and let $\bar{G} = G/N$. Prove that if $G = \langle x, y \rangle$ then $\bar{G} = \langle \bar{x}, \bar{y} \rangle$. Prove more generally that if $G = \langle S \rangle$ for any subset $S$ of $G$, then $\bar{G} = \langle \bar{S} \rangle$.
    \begin{sol}
        If $G = \gen S$, then for every $g \in G$, we have
        \[g = s_1s_2 \dots s_n \quad \text{where $s_i \in S$ for $1 \le i \le n$}\]
        Let $\bar S = \{sN \mid s \in S\}$. Then for any $\bar g \in \bar G$, we have
        \[gN = (s_1s_2 \ldots s_n)N = (s_1N)(s_2N) \dots (s_nN)\]
        so that $\bar g \in \bar S$. Hence, $\bar G = \gen{\bar S}$. The case where $\bar G = \gen{\bar x, \bar y}$ is similar, where every element $g \in G$ is of the form $g = w(x, y)$, where $w(x, y)$ denotes a word in $\gen{x, y}$.

    \begin{solalph}
        \item Since $\gen{r^4} = \set{1, r^4}$, each coset in $\bar G$ has 2 elements and partitions $G$ into 8 sets. Hence, $\abs{\bar G} = 8$.
        \item The elements of $\bar G$ are
        \begin{align*}
            \bar 1 & = \{1, r^4\}, & \bar{s} & = \{s, sr^4\} \\

        \item $\bar{rs} = \bar{sr^3}, \bar{sr^{-2}s} = \bar r^2, \bar{s\inv r\inv sr} = \bar r^2$.
        \item We first note that $\bar H = \{1, \bar r^2, \bar s, \bar{sr^2}\}$. To show that $\bar H \nsub \bar G$, we simplify the process by noting that elements of $\bar G$ are of the form $\bar r^k$ or $\bar{sr^k}$. If an element is of the former, we have
        \begin{align*}
            \bar{r^kr^2r^{-k}} = \bar r^2 \in \bar H \\
            \bar{r^ksr^{-k}} = \bar{s(r^2)^{-k}} \in \bar H
        \end{align*}
        If it is of the latter, then
        \begin{align*}
            \bar{(sr^k)r^2(r^{-k}s)} = \bar{r^{-2}} \in H \\
            \bar{(sr^k)s(r^{-k}s)} = \bar{s(r^2)^k} \in H
        \end{align*}
        where $\bar{sr^k}\inv = \bar{r^{-k}s}$. The above calculations show that for every $\bar g \in \bar G$, then $\bar{gr^2g\inv}, \bar{gsg\inv} \in H$ so that $\bar{gHg\inv} = \bar H$, hence $\bar H \nsub \bar G$. Moreover, it is easy to see that every element of $\bar H$ is of order 2 so that $\bar H \cong V_4$.

        Let $\pi : G \to \bar G$ be the natural projection of $G$ onto $\bar G$. Then $\pi\inv(\bar H)$ is the complete preimage of $\bar H$, or the set of elements that map to a coset in $\bar H$. Using part (b), we see that
        \[\pi\inv(\bar H) = \{1, r^2, r^4, r^6, s, sr^2, sr^4, sr^6\}\]
        Note that $|\pi\inv(\bar H)| = 8$, and the elements of $\bar H$ satisfy the relations $(r^2)^4 = s^2 = 1$. Then the mapping $\phi : D_8 \to \pi\inv(\bar H)$ given by $\phi(r) = r^2$ and $\phi(s) = s$ extends to a homomorphism that is clearly surjective. Then $\phi$ is an isomorphism, and $\pi\inv(\bar H) \cong D_8$.
        \item From the previous exercise, we have that $\bar G = \gen{\bar r, \bar s}$. Since $\bar r^2$ commutes with both $\bar r$ and $\bar s$, then $\bar r^2 \in Z(\bar G)$. However, $\bar{rs} \neq \bar{sr}$ and $\bar{r^3s} \neq \bar{sr^3}$. Additionally, none of $\bar{sr}, \bar{sr^2}$, nor $\bar{sr^3}$ commute with $\bar r$ so that $Z(\bar G) = \{\bar 1, \bar r^2\}$. The elements of $\widehat G = \bar G/Z(\bar G)$ are as follows:
        \begin{align*}
            \hat 1 & = \{\bar 1, \bar r^2\} & \hat s & = \{\bar s, \bar{sr^2}\} \\
            \hat r & = \{\bar r, \bar r^3\} & \widehat{sr} & = \{\bar{sr}, \bar{sr^3}\}
        \end{align*}
        One can see that each nonidentity element of $\widehat G$ has order 2 so that $\widehat G \cong V_4$.

Then the mapping $\phi : \bar G \to D_8$ given by $\phi(\bar\sigma) = r$ and $\phi(\bar\tau) = s$ extends to a surjective homomorphism, hence $\bar G \cong D_8$.

        \[\phi(a) = \bar{xy}, \quad \phi(b) = \bar x\]
        extends to a unique homomorphism. Now suppose $\phi(a^sb^t) = \phi(a^ub^v)$. Then $\bar{xy}^s\bar x^t = \bar{xy}^u\bar x^v$. Since $\gen{\bar{xy}} \cap \gen{\bar x}$ is trivial, then $\bar{xy}^{s - u} = \bar x^{v - t}$ imply that both quantities must be one. Then $\bar{xy}^s = \bar{xy}^u$ and $\bar x^v = \bar x^t$. Then $s \equiv u \bmod 2$ and $v \equiv t \bmod 4$, so that $a^sb^t = a^ub^t$ since $\abs a = 2$ and $\abs b = 4$. Then $\phi$ is injective. Because $\abs{Z_2 \times Z_4} = \abs{\bar G} = 8$, then $\phi$ is an isomorphism, hence $\bar G \cong Z_2 \times Z_4 \cong Z_4 \times Z_2$.

        \[N = \bigcap_{i \in I} N_i\]
        Since $N \leq G$, what remains to be shown is that $gNg\inv \subseteq N$ for some $g \in G$. To that end, let $n \in N$. Then $gng\inv \in N_i$ for each $i \in I$ because $N_i \nsub G$. It follows that $gng\inv \in N$ so that $gNg\inv \subseteq N$.

        \[gng\inv = g(n_1n_2 \ldots n_k)g\inv = (gn_1g\inv)(gn_2g\inv) \cdots (gn_kg\inv)\]
        Because $gng\inv$ is written as a product of elements where each one belongs to some $N_i$, it follows that it is in the join $N$, hence $gNg\inv \subseteq N$. Then $N \nsub G$.

        \[(ga\inv g\inv)(gag\inv) = ga\inv (g\inv g) ag\inv = g(a\inv a)g\inv = gg\inv = 1\]

        \item If $S$ is empty, then $N$ is trivial, so the result follows. Suppose $S$ is not empty, and pick $n \in N$. Because $N = \gen S$, then we have $n = s_1s_2 \ldots s_k$, where $s_i \in S$ for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k$. Since 
        \[gng\inv = (gs_1g\inv)(gs_2g\inv) \cdots (gs_kg\inv)\]
        for every $g \in G$, and $gSg\inv \subseteq N$, then the right hand side is also in $N$, hence $gNg\inv \subseteq N$ so that $N \nsub G$.

If $S$ is nonempty, note that part (a) shows that for any $g \in G$ and $s \in S$, then $\abs{gsg\inv} = \abs s = n$ so that $gsg\inv \in S \subseteq N$. Then $gSg\inv \subseteq N$, hence $N \nsub G$ by part (c).

If $\phi(m) = \phi(n)$, then $gmg\inv = gng\inv$ so that $\phi$ is injective by cancellation. Moreover, if $m \in gNg\inv$, there exists $n \in N$ such that $m = gng\inv = \phi(n)$ so that $\phi$ is surjective. It follows that $\phi$ is a bijection, and $\abs N = \abs{gNg\inv}$. Since $gNg\inv \subseteq N$, and $N$ is finite, it follows that $gNg\inv = N$.

Then $n = s_1s_2 \dots s_k$, where $s_i \in S$ for every $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k$. Then $gng\inv = gs_1g\inv gs_2g\inv \ldots gs_kg\inv \in N$ because $gs_ig\inv \in gSg\inv \subseteq N$. Then $gNg\inv \subseteq N$, and by the previous exercise, $g \in N_G(N)$.

    \item Let $N$ be a \textit{finite} subgroup of $G$ and suppose $G = \langle T \rangle$ and $N = \langle S \rangle$ for some subsets $S$ and $T$ of $G$. Prove that $N$ is normal in $G$ if and only if $tSt^{-1} \subseteq N$ for all $t \in T$.
    \begin{sol}
        \rightimp Immediate, since $gNg\inv = N$ for every $g \in G$, so $tSt\inv \subseteq N$.

        \noindent \leftimp Suppose $S$ and $T$ are nonempty subsets of $G$, and let $g \in G$. Since $g \in \gen T$, then $g = t_1t_2 \dots t_k$, where $t_i \in T$ for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k$. Since we need to show this for every $g \in G$, we must proceed by inducting on the word length of $g \in \gen T$. To that end, $t_1St_1\inv \subseteq N$, so the base case is satisfied. Assume now that $gSg\inv \subseteq N$ when $g$ is some $k$-length word made up of elements from $T$. Consider the $k+1$-length word $g = t_1t_2 \ldots t_kt_{k + 1}$, where $t_i \in T$ for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k + 1$. For notation, set $\hat t = t_1t_2 \ldots t_k$ so that $g = \hat tt_{k + 1}$. The induction assumption shows that $\hat tS\hat t\inv \subseteq N$. For any $s \in S$, then 
        \[gsg\inv = \hat tt_{k + 1}st_{k + 1}\inv h\inv = \hat t(t_{k + 1}st_{k + 1}\inv)\hat t\inv\]
        where $t_{k + 1}st_{k + 1}\inv \in N$ because $tSt\inv \subseteq N$ for every $t \in T$. Since $N = \gen S$, then we may set $t_{k + 1}st_{k + 1}\inv = s_1s_2 \ldots s_m$, where $s_i \in S$ for every $i = 1, 2, \ldots, m$. Then
        \[\hat t(t_{k + 1}st_{k + 1}\inv)\hat t\inv = (\hat ts_1\hat t\inv)(\hat ts_2 \hat t\inv) \cdots (\hat ts_m \hat t\inv) \in N\]
        Hence, $gsg\inv \in N$ so that $gSg\inv \subseteq N$. Induction shows that this is true for every $g \in G$, and by finiteness of $N$, we use the result from the previous exercise to conclude that $N \nsub G$.

Moreover, if $n \in N$, then for some $n' \in N$ we have $gn = n'g$ so that $gng\inv = n'$, hence $gNg\inv \subseteq N$, hence $g \in N_G(N)$.
        
        \noindent \leftimp Suppose $g \in N_G(N)$ and $n \in N$. Since $n \in gNg\inv$, there exists $n' \in N$ such that $n = gn'g\inv$ so that $ng = gn'$, hence $n \in gN$, and $Ng \subseteq gN$. By symmetry, we have $gN \subseteq Ng$, hence $gN = Ng$.

    \item Prove that if $H \le G$ and $N$ is a normal subgroup of $H$ then $H \le N_G(N)$. Deduce that $N_G(N)$ is the largest subgroup of $G$ in which $N$ is normal (i.e. is the join of all subgroups $H$ for which $N \nsub H$).
    \begin{sol}
        If $h \in H$, then $hNh\inv = N$ because $N \nsub H$, hence $h \in N_G(N)$. Because $N_G(N) \leq G$, then $H \subseteq N_G(N)$ implies $H \leq N_G(N)$. Moreover, since every subgroup such that $N$ is normal in is a subgroup of $N_G(N)$, then $N_G(N)$ is the largest subgroup in which $N$ is normal.
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove that every subgroup of $Q_8$ is normal. For each subgroup find the isomorphism type of its corresponding quotient. [You may use the lattice of subgroups for $Q_8$ in Section 2.5.]
    \begin{sol}
        By the lattice, the subgroups of $Q_8$ are 1, $\gen{-1}, \gen i, \gen j, \gen k$, and $Q_8$. It is clear that $Q_8/1 \cong Q_8$, and $Q_8/Q_8 \cong 1$. Now, the lattice shows that $\gen i, \gen j$, and $\gen k$ are all maximal subgroups, so their normalizers must either be themselves, or $Q_8$. Since $j\gen i (-j) = \gen i$, then $j \in N_{Q_8}(\gen i)$ so that $N_{Q_8}(\gen i) = Q_8$. We may similarly argue that $N_{Q_8}(\gen j) = N_{Q_8}(\gen k) = Q_8$. Moreover, $Z(Q_8) = \gen{-1}$, and every center of a group is normal. It follows that every subgroup of $Q_8$ is normal.
        
        Let us first examine $Q_8/\gen{-1} = \{\bar 1, \bar i, \bar j, \bar k\}$. Since $\bar i^2 = \bar{-1} = \bar 1$, then $\abs{\bar i} = 2$. We can argue that $\abs{\bar j} = \abs{\bar k} = 2$ so that $Q_8/\gen{-1} \cong V_4$. The quotient group $Q_8/\gen i = \{\bar 1, \bar j\}$ has order 2 so $Q_8/\gen i \cong Z_2$. By symmetry, $Q_8/\gen j \cong Q_8/\gen k \cong Z_2$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Find all normal subgroups of $D_8$ and for each of these find the isomorphism type of its corresponding quotient. [You may use the lattice of subgroups for $D_8$ in Section 2.5.]
    \begin{sol}
        Again, $D_8/1 \cong D_8$ and $D_8/D_8 \cong 1$. Examining the three maximal subgroups $\gen{s, r^2}, \gen r$, and $\gen{rs, r^2}$. observe the following:
        \begin{align*}
            r\gen{s, r^2}r\inv & = \{1, sr^2. r^2, s\} = \gen{s, r^2} \\
            s\gen r s\inv & = \{1, r^3, r^2, r\} = \gen r \\
            r\gen{rs, r^2}r\inv & = \{1, sr, r^2, sr^3\} = \gen{rs, r^2}
        \end{align*}
        then the normalizers of each subgroup contain $r$ and $s$, hence $N_{D_8}(\gen{s, r^2}) = N_{D_8}(\gen r) = N_{D_8}(\gen{rs, r^2}) = Q_8$. Moreover, each of these maximal subgroups are of order 4, which means their corresponding quotient groups will have order 2, hence $Q_8/\gen{s, r^2} \cong Q_8/\gen r \cong Q_8/\gen{rs, r^2} \cong Z_2$.

        Now we examine $\gen{r^2} = Z(D_8)$ so it is clearly normal. Then $D_8/\gen{r^2} = \{\bar 1, \bar r, \bar s, \bar{sr}\}$. Note that the nonidentity elements have order 2, and so $D_8/\gen{r^2} \cong V_4$.

        For the remaining subgroups of order 2, observe that
        \begin{align*}
            r\gen{s}r\inv & = \{1, sr^2\} \neq \gen s \\
            r\gen{sr}r\inv & = \{1, rs\} \neq \gen{sr} \\
            r\gen{sr^2}r\inv & = \{1, s\} \neq \gen{sr^2} \\
            r\gen{sr^3}r\inv & = \{1, sr\} \neq \gen{sr^3}
        \end{align*}
        so that none of the subgroups of order 2 contain $r$, hence none of them are normal.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $D_{2n} = \langle r,s \mid r^n = s^2 = 1,\ rs = sr^{-1} \rangle$ be the usual presentation of the dihedral group of order $2n$ and let $k$ be a positive integer dividing $n$.
    \begin{problems}
        \item Prove that $\langle r^k \rangle$ is a normal subgroup of $D_{2n}$.
        \item Prove that $D_{2n}/\langle r^k \rangle \cong D_{2k}$.
    \end{problems}
    \begin{solalph}
        \item Observe that $\gen{r^k} = \{1, r^k, r^{2k}, \ldots, r^{n - k}\}$. It is clear that $r\gen{r^k}r\inv = \gen{r^k}$, and observe that $sr^ks\inv = r^{-k} = r^{n - k}$ so that $s\gen{r^k}s\inv = \gen{r^k}$. Since $r, s \in N_{D_{2n}}(\gen{r^k})$, then $\gen{r^k} \nsub D_{2n}$.
        \item Consider $D_{2n}/\gen{r^k}$. Since $k \mid n$, then the order of $\gen{r^k}$ is $n/k$, and the number of cosets in the quotient group is $2n/(n/k) = 2k$. Now consider the cosets $\bar r$ and $\bar s$:
        \[\bar r = \{r, r^{k + 1}, r^{2k + 1}, \ldots, r^{n - k + 1}\} \quad \text{and} \quad \bar s = \{s, sr^k, sr^{2k}, \ldots, sr^{n - k}\}\]
        It is clear that $\bar s \neq \bar 1$, and $\bar s^2 = \bar 1$ so that $\abs{\bar s} = 2$. Moreover, $\bar r^k = \bar 1$, hence $\abs{\bar r} \leq k$. However, note that $\bar r^i = \bar 1$ when $i \mid k$ so that $\abs{\bar r} = k$. This clearly satisfies the relations for $D_{2k}$, hence $D_{2n}/\gen{r^k} \cong D_{2k}$. 
    \end{solalph}
    \item \label{ex3.1.35} Prove that $\speclin_n(F) \nsub \gl_n(F)$ and describe the isomorphism type of the quotient group (cf. Exercise 9, Section 2.1).
    \begin{sol}
        We know that $\speclin_n(F) \leq \gl_n(F)$, so we just need to show that $A \speclin_n(F) A\inv = \speclin_n(F)$ for all $A \in \gl_n(F)$. To that end, note that for any $S \in \speclin_n(F)$ and $X \in \gl_n(F)$, then $\det(XSX\inv) = \det(X)\det(S)\det(X\inv) = 1$, hence $X\speclin_n(F)X\inv \subseteq \speclin_n(F)$, and $\speclin_n(F) \nsub \gl_n(F)$.

        Recall that when a subgroup is normal, it is actually the kernel of some homomorphism. Observe that every element of $\speclin_n(F)$ has determinant 1, so if we consider the mapping $A \mapsto \det(A)$ for some $A \in \gl_n(F)$, then the kernel of this homomorphism is clearly $\speclin_n(F)$. We may then consider the mapping $\phi : \gl_n(F)/\speclin_n(F) \to F\unt$ given by $\phi(\bar X) = \det(X)$.

        We now show that this mapping is well defined. Suppose $\bar A = \bar B$ for some $\bar A, \bar B \in \gl_n(F)/\speclin_n(F)$. Recall that the elements of $\bar A$ are of the form $AS$ for $A \in \gl_n(F)$ and some $S \in \speclin_n(F)$. Since $\bar A = \bar B$, then for $AS \in \bar A$ there exists $S' \in \speclin_n(F)$ such that $AS = BS_0$. Then
        \[\phi(\bar A) = \det(A) = \det(AS) = \det(BS') = \det(B) = \phi(\bar B)\]
        so that $\phi$ is well defined.
        
        To show that $\phi$ is injective, suppose $\phi(\bar A) = \phi(\bar B)$. Then $\det(A) = \det(B)$. Pick some $AS \in \bar A$, where $S \in \speclin_n(F)$. Observe that $B\inv AS \in \speclin_n(F)$, since $\det(B\inv AS) = \det(B\inv)\det(A)\det(S) = \det(A)\inv\det(A)\det(S) = 1$, hence $B\inv AS = S'$ for some $S' \in \speclin_n(F)$. Then $AS = BS'$, and $AS \in \bar B$ so that $\bar A \subseteq \bar B$. A similar argument shows that $\bar B \subseteq \bar A$ so that $\bar A = \bar B$, and $\phi$ is injective. Moreover, for some $f \in F\unt$, then $\det(fI_n) = f\det(I_n) = f$ so that $\phi$ is surjective. Lastly, for $\bar A, \bar B \in \speclin_n(F)$, then 
        \[\phi(\bar{AB}) = \det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B) = \phi(\bar A)\phi(\bar B)\]
        so that $\phi$ is a homomorphism. Then $\phi$ is a bijective homomorphism, and $\gl_n(F)/\speclin_n(F) \cong F\unt$.

    \item \label{ex3.1.36} Prove that if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic then $G$ is abelian. [If $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic with generator $xZ(G)$, show that every element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^a z$ for some integer $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and some element $z \in Z(G)$.]
    \begin{sol}
        Suppose $G/Z(G) = \gen{xZ(G)}$ for some $x \in G$. Then cosets are of the form $x^aZ(G)$ for some $a \in \z$. Suppose $g, h \in G$. Since both $g$ and $h$ belong to some coset in $G/Z(G)$, then $g = x^mz$ and $h = x^nz'$ for some $m, n \in \z$ and $z, z' \in Z(G)$. Then
        \[ab = (x^mz)(x^nz') = (x^nz')(x^mz) = ba\]
        so that $G$ is abelian.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $A$ and $B$ be groups. Show that $\{(a,1) \mid a \in A\}$ is a normal subgroup of $A \times B$ and the quotient of $A \times B$ by this subgroup is isomorphic to $B$.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $C$ be the the given set. It is clear that $C \leq A \times B$. Suppose $(a, b) \in A \times B$. Then for any $(a', 1) \in C$, we have
        \[(a, b)(a', 1)(a, b)\inv = (aa'a\inv, b1b\inv) = (aa'a\inv, 1) \in C\]
        so that $C \nsub A \times B$.

        Consider the mapping $\phi : A \times B/C \to B$ given by $\phi(\bar{(a, b)}) = b$. To show that this is well-defined, suppose $\bar{(a, b)} = \bar{(a', b')}$. Then $(a, b)C = (a', b')C$, which implies that $C = (a\inv, b\inv)(a', b')C$, or that $(a\inv a', b\inv b') \in C$. Then $b\inv b' = 1$, or $b = b'$ so that $\phi$ is well-defined.

        Now suppose $\phi(\bar{(a, b)}) = \phi(\bar{(a', b')})$. Then $b = b'$ so that $(a, b)C = (a', b')C$, hence $\phi$ is injective. Moreover, $\phi(\bar{(1, b)}) = b$ so that $\phi$ is surjective. Lastly, for $\bar{(a, b)}, \bar{(a', b')} \in A \times B/C$, then 
        \[\phi(\bar{(a, b)}\bar{(a', b')}) = \phi(\bar{(aa', bb')}) = bb' = \phi(\bar{(a, b)})\phi(\bar{(a', b')})\]
        so that $\phi$ is a bijective homomorphism. Hence, $A \times B/C \cong B$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $A$ be an abelian group and let $D$ be the (diagonal) subgroup $\{(a,a) \mid a \in A\}$ of $A \times A$. Prove that $D$ is a normal subgroup of $A \times A$ and $(A \times A)/D \cong A$.
    \begin{sol}
        Since $A$ is abelian, then $A \times A$ is abelian, hence any subgroup is normal so that $D \nsub A \times A$.

        Now consider two cosets $\bar{(a_1, a_2)}, \bar{(a_3, a_4)} \in (A \times A)/D$. Then $\bar{(a_1, a_2)} = \bar{(a_3, a_4)}$ when we have $(a_1, a_2)\inv(a_3, a_4) \in D$, which implies that $a_1\inv a_3 = a_2\inv a_4$, or $a_3a_4\inv = a_1a_2\inv$. We can construct a well-defined, injective homomorphism $\phi : (A \times A)/D \to A$ given by $\phi(\bar{(a, b)}) = ab\inv$. Moreover, this is surective, since $\phi(\bar{(a, 1)}) = a$ for any $a \in A$. Lastly, it is a homomorphism, because
        \begin{align*}
            \phi(\bar{(a_1, b_1)(a_2, b_2)}) & = \phi(\bar{(a_1a_2, b_1b_2)}) \\
            & = (a_1a_2)(b_1b_2)\inv \\
            & = (a_1b_1\inv)(a_2b_2\inv) \\
            & = \phi(\bar{(a_1, b_1)})\phi(\bar{(a_2, b_2)})
        \end{align*}
        Hence, $\phi$ is a bijective homomorphism, and $(A \times A)/D \cong A$.

        Let $\alpha, \beta \in S_3$, where $\alpha = 1$ and $\beta = (1\ 2\ 3)$ so that $\alpha\inv = \alpha$ and $\beta\inv \neq \beta$. For $\gamma = (1\ 2) \in S_3$, consider $\alpha\gamma\alpha\inv$ and $\beta\gamma\beta\inv$. Observe that $\alpha\gamma\alpha\inv = \gamma$, while $\beta\gamma\beta\inv = (1\ 2\ 3)(1\ 2)(3\ 2\ 1) = (2\ 3) \neq (1\ 2) = \gamma$. Then $(\alpha, \beta)(\gamma, \gamma)(\alpha\inv, \beta\inv) = (\gamma, (2\ 3))$, hence $D$ is not a normal subgroup of $S_3 \times S_3$.

    \item Let $G$ be a group. Prove that $N = \langle x^{-1}y^{-1}xy \mid x,y \in G \rangle$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and $G/N$ is abelian ($N$ is called the \textit{commutator} subgroup of $G$).
    \begin{sol}
        Let $g \in G$ and $x\inv y\inv xy \in N$. Then 
        \[g(x\inv y\inv xy)g\inv = (gx\inv g\inv)(g y\inv g\inv)(gxg\inv)(gyg\inv) = (gxg\inv)\inv(gyg\inv)\inv(gxg\inv)(gyg\inv) \in N\]
        so that $g[x, y]g\inv = [gxg\inv, gyg\inv] \in N$. Then $gNg\inv \subseteq N$, hence $N \nsub G$.
        
        $G/N$ is abelian, since the previous exercise shows that $\bar x$ and $\bar y$ in $G/N$ commute when $[x, y] \in N$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Assume both $H$ and $K$ are normal subgroups of $G$ with $H \cap K = 1$. Prove that $xy = yx$ for all $x \in H$ and $y \in K$. [Show $x^{-1}y^{-1}xy \in H \cap K$.]
    \begin{sol}
        Let $x \in H$ and $y \in K$. Since $H \nsub G$, then $y\inv xy \in H$, hence $[x, y] \in H$. Since $K \nsub G$, then $x\inv y\inv x\in K$, hence $[x, y] \in K$. Then $[x, y] \in H \cap K = 1$ so that $[x, y] = 1$. It follows that $x\inv y\inv xy = 1$, or $xy = yx$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Assume $\mathcal{P} = \{A_i \mid i \in I\}$ is any partition of $G$ with the property that $\mathcal{P}$ is a group under the ``quotient operation'' defined as follows: to compute the product of $A_i$ with $A_j$ take any element $a_i$ of $A_i$ and any element $a_j$ of $A_j$ and let $A_iA_j$ be the element of $\mathcal{P}$ containing $a_ia_j$ (this operation is assumed to be well defined). Prove that the element of $\mathcal{P}$ that contains the identity of $G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and the elements of $\mathcal{P}$ are the cosets of this subgroup (so $\mathcal{P}$ is just a quotient group of $G$ in the usual sense).
    \begin{sol}
        For any $g \in G$, let $\bar g \in \pp$ be the element such that $g \in \bar g$. Now, $\bar 1 \in \pp$ is the set such that $1 \in \bar 1$ so that $\bar 1$ is nonempty. Moreover, for any $g, h \in \bar 1$, we have $\bar{gh} = \bar g \cdot \bar h = \bar 1 \cdot \bar 1 = \bar 1$ so that $\bar 1$ is closed under the operation. Lastly, we have that $\bar{g\inv} = \bar{g\inv} \cdot \bar 1 = \bar{g\inv} \cdot \bar g = \bar{g\inv g} = \bar 1$ so that $\bar 1$ is closed under inverses, hence $\bar 1 \leq G$.
        
        To show that $\bar 1 \nsub G$, let $g \in G$ and $x \in \bar 1$. Then $\bar{gxg\inv} = \bar g \cdot \bar x \cdot \bar{g\inv} = \bar g \cdot \bar 1 \cdot \bar{g\inv} = \bar{gg\inv} = \bar 1$, hence $gxg\inv \in \bar 1$ so that $\bar 1 \nsub G$.

        Consider some $g\bar 1 \in G/\bar 1$, and let $\bar g \in \pp$. For some $gy \in g\bar 1$ where $y \in \bar 1$, then $\bar{gy} = \bar g \cdot \bar y = \bar g \cdot \bar 1 = \bar g$ so that $gy \in \bar g$, hence $g \bar 1 \subseteq \bar g$. If $x \in \bar g$, then $\bar x = \bar g$ so that $\bar{g\inv x} = \bar{g\inv g} = \bar 1$, hence $g\inv x \in \bar 1$. Then $x = gg\inv x = g(g\inv x) \in g\bar 1$, hence $\bar g \subseteq g\bar 1$. It follows that $\bar g = g\bar 1$.

\subsection{More on Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem}

Let $G$ be a group.

\begin{problems}
    \item Which of the following are permissible orders for subgroups of a group of order 120: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 15, 60, 240? For each permissible order give the corresponding index.
    \begin{sol}
        Only 1, 2, 5, 9, 15, and 60 are permissible orders for subgroups of a group of order 120. The corresponding indices are 120, 60, 24, 12, 8, and 2, respectively.
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove that the lattice of subgroups of $S_3$ in Section 2.5 is correct (i.e., prove that it contains all subgroups of $S_3$ and that their pairwise joins and intersections are correctly drawn).
    \begin{sol}
        Since $|S_3| = 6$, then Lagrange's Theorem shows that non-trivial subgroups are of order 2 and 3. Clearly, none of the cyclic subgroups of order 2 can be contained in $\gen{(1\ 2\ 3)}$ since it has order 3. Moreover, $\gen{(1\ 2\ 3)} = \gen{(1\ 3\ 2)}$, hence all cyclic subgroups are accounted for, and the containment is correct.

        To prove that the subgroups of $S_3$ are only the cyclic subgroups in the lattice, suppose $S_3$ has a non-cyclic subgroup $H$ of order 3, and suppose $H = \gen{\sigma, \tau}$ for some $\sigma, \tau \in S_3$. We then have $H = \set{1, \sigma, \tau}$. Since $\abs\sigma$ divides $\abs H$, it must be that $\abs\sigma = 3$, hence $\sigma$ and $\sigma^2$ are distinct elements so that $\tau = \sigma^2$. Then $H = \gen\sigma$, contradicting it was non-cyclic. Hence, all proper subgroups of $S_3$ are cyclic, and the lattice is correct.
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove that the lattice of subgroups of $Q_8$ in Section 2.5 is correct.
    \begin{sol}
        Lagrange's Theorem shows that the possible orders of subgroups of $Q_8$ are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The only possible subgroup of order 2 is $\gen{-1}$ since it is the only element of order 2 in $Q_8$. The only subgroups of order 4 are $\gen i, \gen j$, ad $\gen k$ since every other nonidentity element has order 4 and are contained in one of these subgroups.

        Since $\gen{-1}$ is contained in each of $\gen i, \gen j$, and $\gen k$, and the subgroups of order 4 are maximal via Lagrange's, then the lattice is correct.
    \end{sol}
    \item Show that if $|G| = pq$ for some primes $p$ and $q$ (not necessarily distinct) then either $G$ is abelian or $Z(G) = 1$. [See \hyperref[ex3.1.36]{Exercise 3.1.36}.]
    \begin{sol}
        If $G$ is abelian, then we are done. Suppose $G$ is not abelian. It follows that $Z(G)$ is a proper subgroup of $G$, and by Lagrange's Theorem, the order of $Z(G)$ must be either 1, $p$, or $q$. Assume $Z(G)$ is not trivial, and without loss of generality, assume $|Z(G)| = p$. Since $Z(G) \nsub G$ as $Z(G)$ is abelian, then we may Lagrange's again to obtain $\abs{G/Z(G)} = \abs G/\abs{Z(G)} = q$, which is prime. Then $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, so by \hyperref[ex3.1.36]{Exercise 3.1.36}, $G$ is abelian, a contradiction. Hence, $Z(G) = 1$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and fix some element $g \in G$. 
    \begin{problems}
        \item Prove that $gH g^{-1}$ is a subgroup of $G$ of the same order as $H$.
        \item Deduce that if $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and $H$ is the unique subgroup of $G$ of order $n$ then $H \nsub G$.
    \end{problems}
    \begin{solalph}
        \item Since $1 \in H$, then $g1g\inv = 1 \in gHg\inv$ so that $gHg\inv$ is nonempty. Now suppose $gxg\inv, gyg\inv \in gHg\inv$ for some $x, y \in H$. Then
        \[(gxg\inv)(gyg\inv)\inv = gxg\inv gy\inv g\inv = gxy\inv g\inv \in gHg\inv\]
        since $xy\inv \in H$. Hence, $gHg\inv \leq G$.

        Define a map $\phi : H \to gHg\inv$ by $\phi(h) = ghg\inv$. To show that this is a bijection, suppose $\phi(h_1) = \phi(h_2)$. Then $gh_1g\inv = gh_2g\inv$, hence $h_1 = h_2$ so that $\phi$ is injective. Moreover, for any $ghg\inv \in gHg\inv$, then $\phi(h) = ghg\inv$ so that $\phi$ is surjective. Hence, $\abs{gHg\inv} = \abs H$.
        \item Let $g \in G$. Since $H$ is the unique subgroup of $G$ of order $n$, then by part (a), $gHg\inv$ is a subgroup of $G$ of order $n$, hence $gHg\inv = H$. It follows that $H \nsub G$.
    \end{solalph}
    \item Let $H \leq G$ and let $g \in G$. Prove that if the right coset $Hg$ equals some left coset of $H$ in $G$ then it equals the left coset $gH$ and $g$ must be in $N_G(H)$.
    \begin{sol}
        Suppose $Hg = g'H$ for some $g' \in G$. Note that $g \in Hg$ so that $g \in g'H$. Then $Hg = g'H = gH$, hence $Hg = gH$, and $g \in N_G(H)$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $H \leq G$ and define a relation $\sim$ on $G$ by $a \sim b$ if and only if $b^{-1}a \in H$. Prove that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation and describe the equivalence class of each $a \in G$. Use this to prove Proposition 4.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $h \in H$. Since $h\inv h = 1 \in H$, then $h \sim h$ so that $\sim$ is reflexive. Suppose $g, h \in H$ such that $g \sim h$. Then $h\inv g \in H$, hence $g\inv h = (h\inv g)\inv \in H$ so that $h \sim g$ and $\sim$ is symmetric. Lastly, suppose $g, h, k \in G$ such that $g \sim h$ and $h \sim k$. Then $h\inv g \in H$ and $k\inv h \in H$, hence $(k\inv h)(h\inv g) = k\inv g \in H$ so that $g \sim k$ and $\sim$ is transitive. It follows that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.

        The equivalence class of some $a \in G$ is given by $\set{b \in G \mid b\inv a \in H}$. Note that $b$ is in the equivalence class of $a$ when $b\inv a = h$ for some $h \in H$, hence $b = ah\inv$. The set becomes $\set{ah\inv \mid h \in H}$, which is the left coset of $H$ containing $a$. Since the equivalence classes partition $G$, then the left cosets of $H$ partition $G$, by Proposition 0.2, then the left cosets of $H$ in $G$ form a partition of $G$, proving Proposition 4.
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove that if $H$ and $K$ are finite subgroups of $G$ whose orders are relatively prime then $|H \cap K| = 1$.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $\abs H = m$ and $\abs K = n$ such that $(m, n) = 1$. Let $\ell = \abs{H \cap K}$. Since $H \cap K \leq H$ and $H \cap K \leq K$, then by Lagrange's Theorem, $\ell \mid m$ and $\ell \mid n$. It follows that $\ell \mid (m, n) = 1$, hence $\ell = 1$.
    \end{sol}
    \item This exercise outlines a proof of Cauchy's Theorem due to James McKay (\textit{Another proof of Cauchy's group theorem}, Amer. Math. Monthly, 66 (1959), p. 119). Let $G$ be a finite group and let $p$ be a prime dividing $|G|$. Let $\ss$ denote the set of $p$-tuples of elements of $G$ the product of whose coordinates is 1:
    \[\ss = \{(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p) \mid x_i \in G \text{ and } x_1x_2 \cdots x_p = 1\}\]
    \begin{problems}
        \item Show that $\ss$ has $|G|^{p-1}$ elements, hence has order divisible by $p$.
    \end{problems}
    Define the relation $\sim$ on $S$ by letting $\alpha \sim \beta$ if $\beta$ is a cyclic permutation of $\alpha$.
    \begin{problems}[resume]
        \item Show that a cyclic permutation of an element of $\ss$ is again an element of $\ss$.
        \item Prove that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $\ss$.
        \item Prove that an equivalence class contains a single element if and only if it is of the form $(x, x, \dots, x)$ with $x^p = 1$.
        \item Prove that every equivalence class has order 1 or $p$ (this uses the fact that $p$ is \textit{prime}). Deduce that $|G|^{p-1} = k + pd$, where $k$ is the number of classes of size 1 and $d$ is the number of classes of size $p$.
        \item Since $\{(1, 1, \dots, 1)\}$ is an equivalence class of size 1, conclude from (e) that there must be a nonidentity element $x \in G$ with $x^p = 1$, i.e., $G$ contains an element of order $p$. [Show $p \mid k$ and so $k > 1$.]
    \end{problems}
    \begin{solalph}
        \item Consider the $(p - 1)$-tuples of elements of $G$, and call this set $\ss'$. Clearly, $\ss'$ has $|G|^{p-1}$ elements. Now define a mapping $\phi : \ss' \to \ss$ by $\phi(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{p-1}) = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{p-1}, (x_1x_2 \cdots x_{p-1})\inv)$. Now suppose $\phi(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{p-1}) = \phi(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_{p-1})$. Then $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{p-1}, (x_1x_2 \cdots x_{p-1})\inv) = (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_{p-1}, (y_1y_2 \cdots y_{p-1})\inv)$ so that $x_i = y_i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq p - 1$, hence $\phi$ is injective. Moreover, this mapping is clearly surjective. It follows that $\abs\ss = \abs{\ss'} = |G|^{p-1}$.
        \item Let $\alpha = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_p) \in \ss$. A cyclic permutation of $\alpha$ is some $\beta = (x_k, x_{k+1}, \dots, x_p, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{k-1})$ for some $1 \leq k \leq p$ where the indices are taken modulo $p$. Observe that these consist of the same elements as $\alpha$, just in a different order, hence $x_k x_{k+1} \cdots x_p x_1 x_2 \cdots x_{k-1} = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_p = 1$, so that $\beta \in \ss$.
        \item Let $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in \ss$. $\sim$ is clearly reflexive since $\alpha$ is a cyclic permutation of itself. 
        
        Suppose $\alpha \sim \beta$. Then $\beta$ is a cyclic permutation of $\alpha$, hence $\alpha$ is a cyclic permutation of $\beta$, so that $\beta \sim \alpha$ and $\sim$ is symmetric. 
        
        Lastly, suppose $\alpha \sim \beta$ and $\beta \sim \gamma$. Then $\beta$ is a cyclic permutation of $\alpha$, and $\gamma$ is a cyclic permutation of $\beta$, hence $\gamma$ is a cyclic permutation of $\alpha$ by taking the composition of the permutations, so that $\alpha \sim \gamma$ and $\sim$ is transitive. It follows that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $\ss$.
        \item \rightimp Let $[\alpha]$ denote the equivalence class that contains $\alpha$. If $[\alpha]$ contains a single element, then it must be that all cyclic permutations of $\alpha$ are equal, hence $\alpha = (x, x, \dots, x)$ for some $x \in G$. Since $\alpha \in \ss$, then $x^p = 1$.
        
        \noindent \leftimp Suppose $\alpha = (x, x, \dots, x)$ for some $x \in G$ such that $x^p = 1$. Then any cyclic permutation of $\alpha$ is equal to $\alpha$, hence $[\alpha]$ contains a single element.
        \item Let $\alpha = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_p) \in \ss$ where the $x_i$ need not be distinct, and let $[\alpha]$ be the equivalence class containing $\alpha$. Suppose $[\alpha]$ has $n$ elements, and note that $x_i = x_j$ whenever $i + kn \equiv j \bmod p$ for some $k \in \z$ that represents the amount of cyclic shifts.
        
        There are two cases to discuss, either $n = p$ or $1 \leq n < p$. If $n = p$, then we are done. Suppose $1 \leq n < p$. Since $p$ is prime, then $(n, p) = 1$, hence there exists some $k \in \z$ such that $kn \equiv 1 \bmod p$. In particular, $i + kn \equiv i + 1 \equiv j \bmod p$ implies $x_{i + 1} = x_j$. It follows that $x_i = x_j$ for all $1 \leq i, j \leq p$, hence $\alpha = (x, x, \dots, x)$ for some $x \in G$. By part (c), $[\alpha]$ contains a single element.

        Since the equivalence classes partition $\ss$, let $k$ be the number of classes of size 1 and $d$ be the number of classes of size $p$. Then $\abs\ss = k + pd$, as desired.
        \item Because $p$ divides $\abs G$, then it divides $\abs\ss = |G|^{p-1}$. From part (d), we have $|G|^{p-1} = k + pd$, hence $p \mid k$ so that $k > 1$. Then there is at least one equivalence class of size 1 that is not $\{(1, 1, \dots, 1)\}$. By part (c), this equivalence class is of the form $(x, x, \dots, x)$ for some nonidentity $x \in G$ such that $x^p = 1$. It follows that $G$ contains an element of order $p$.
    \end{solalph}
    \item \label{ex3.2.10} Suppose $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of finite index in the (possibly infinite) group $G$ with $|G : H| = m$ and $|G : K| = n$. Prove that $\lcm(m, n) \leq |G : H \cap K| \leq mn$. Deduce that if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime then $|G : H \cap K| = |G : H| \cdot |G : K|$.
    \begin{sol} 
        Let $|G : H \cap K| = \ell$. Consider the cosets $gH, gK$, and $g(H \cap K)$ for some $g \in G$. We wish to identify $g(H \cap K)$ in terms of $gH$ and $gK$. Note that $x \in g(H \cap K)$ implies that $g\inv x \in H \cap K$, hence $g\inv x \in H$ and $g\inv x \in K$, so that $x \in gH$ and $x \in gK$. It follows that $g(H \cap K) \subseteq gH \cap gK$. Now suppose $x \in gH \cap gK$. Then $x \in gH$ and $x \in gK$, hence $g\inv x \in H$ and $g\inv x \in K$, so that $g\inv x \in H \cap K$. It follows that $x \in g(H \cap K)$, hence $gH \cap gK \subseteq g(H \cap K)$. We conclude that $g(H \cap K) = gH \cap gK$.

        Note that the set of cosets of $H \cap K$ in $G$ partitions $G$ into $\ell$ parts, and each coset is the intersection of a coset of $H$ with a coset of $K$. Since there are $m$ cosets of $H$ and $n$ cosets of $K$, then there are at most $mn$ distinct intersections, hence $\ell \leq mn$. 

        We now show that $\ell$ is a multiple of $m$ (a similar argument can be done to show that it is a multiple of $n$). Let $x \in G$. Since the cosets of $H$ in $G$ partition $G$, then there exists a unique $g \in G$ such that $x \in gH$. Moreover, because $H \cap K \leq H$, then the cosets of $H \cap K$ in $H$ partition $H$ so that there exists a unique $h \in H$ such that $x \in gh(H \cap K)$. Pick another coset $h' \neq h$ of $H \cap K$ in $H$. Then $gh(H \cap K) \neq gh'(H \cap K)$ since if they were equal, then $(gh)\inv(gh') = h\inv h' \in H \cap K$, contradicting that $h$ and $h'$ are distinct cosets. It follows that for each coset of $H$ in $G$, there are $\abs{H : H \cap K}$ distinct cosets of $H \cap K$ in $G$. Since there are $m$ cosets of $H$ in $G$, then $\ell = m \abs{H : H \cap K}$, hence $m \mid \ell$. Similarly, $n \mid \ell$. Since $\ell$ is a multiple of both $m$ and $n$, then $\lcm(m, n) \mid \ell$, hence $\lcm(m, n) \leq \ell$, and we have the desired inequality $\lcm(m, n) \leq \ell \leq mn$.

        Lastly, if $(m, n) = 1$, then $\lcm(m, n) = mn$ so that $\ell = mn$.
    \end{sol}
    \item \label{ex3.2.11} Let $H \leq K \leq G$. Prove that $|G : H| = |G : K| \cdot |K : H|$. 
    \begin{sol}
        Note that cosets of $H$ are contained in cosets of $K$. If $H$ has infinite index in $K$ or if $K$ has infinite index in $G$, then $H$ has infinite index in $G$. The finite case follows in the proof of \hyperref[ex3.2.10]{Exercise 3.2.10}, where we showed that each coset of $K$ contains $\abs{K : H}$ distinct cosets of $H$. Since there are $\abs{G : K}$ distinct cosets of $K$ in $G$, then there are $\abs{G : K} \cdot \abs{K : H}$ distinct cosets of $H$ in $G$, hence $\abs{G : H} = \abs{G : K} \cdot \abs{K : H}$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $H \leq G$. Prove that the map $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ sends each left coset of $H$ in $G$ onto a right coset of $H$ and gives a bijection between the set of left cosets and the set of right cosets of $H$ in $G$ (hence the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$ equals the number of right cosets).
    \begin{sol}
        Let $L$ be the set of left cosets of $H$ in $G$ and $R$ be the set of right cosets of $H$ in $G$. Define the map $\phi : L \to R$ be given by $\phi(xH) = Hx\inv$. Firstly, this map is well-defined: suppose $xH = yH$. Then $yx\inv \in H$, hence $(yx\inv)\inv = xy\inv \in H$, so that $Hx\inv = Hy\inv$. Note that the map $\psi : R \to L$ given by $\psi(Hx) = x\inv H$ is well-defined by a similar argument. It is clear that $\phi \circ \psi = 1$ and $\psi \circ \phi = 1$, hence $\psi = \phi\inv$ so that $\phi$ is a bijection. It follows that $\abs L = \abs R$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Fix any labelling of the vertices of a square and use this to identify $D_8$ as a subgroup of $S_4$. Prove that the elements of $D_8$ and $\gen{(123)}$ do not commute in $S_4$.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $D_8 = \{1, (1\ 2\ 3\ 4), (1\ 3)(2\ 4), (1\ 4\ 3\ 2), (2\ 4), (1\ 2)(3\ 4), (1\ 3), (1\ 4)(2\ 3)\}$ be the subgroup of $S_4$, where a square is labelled clockwise from 1 to 4. Note that $D_8$ is generated by $r = (1\ 2\ 3\ 4)$ and $s = (2\ 4)$. Then $(1\ 2\ 3)(1\ 2\ 3\ 4) = (1\ 3\ 4\ 2) \neq (1\ 4\ 3\ 2) = (1\ 2\ 3\ 4)(1\ 2\ 3)$, and $(1\ 2\ 3)(2\ 4) = (1\ 4\ 3) \neq (1\ 3\ 4) = (2\ 4)(1\ 2\ 3)$, so that the generators of $D_8$ do not commute with the generator of $\gen{(1\ 2\ 3)}$. It follows that the elements of $D_8$ and $\gen{(1\ 2\ 3)}$ do not commute in $S_4$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove that $S_4$ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8 or a normal subgroup of order 3.
    \begin{sol}
        Suppose $S_4$ has a normal subgroup $N$ of order 8. By Lagrange's then $N$ cannot contain any 3-cycle. Then elements of $N$ are comprised of at least the identity, 2-cycles, a product of 2 disjoint 2-cycles, or 4-cycles. Observe that $N$ cannot contain all 6 2-cycles of $S_4$ for otherwise $(1\ 2)(1\ 3) = (1\ 3\ 2) \in N$, a contradiction. It must be that there is some 2-cycle $\sigma \in S_4$ that is not in $N$. Since $N \nsub S_4$, then $N \gen\sigma \leq S_4$. Since $\sigma \not\in S_4$, then $N \cap \gen\sigma = 1$, hence $|N \gen\sigma| = 16$. This contradicts Lagrange's Theorem, hence $N$ cannot exist.

        If $S_4$ has a normal subgroup $M$ of order 3, then $M \cong Z_3$ which is cyclic. Since $S_4$ contains 4 distinct 3-cycles, we may pick another $\tau \in S_4$ such that $\tau \not\in M$, hence $M \cap \gen\tau = 1$. Because $M \nsub S_4$, we have $|M \gen\tau| = 9$, contradicting Lagrange's Theorem, hence $M$ cannot exist.

    \item Let $G = S_n$ and for fixed $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ let $G_i$ be the stabilizer of $i$. Prove that $G_i \cong S_{n-1}$.
    \begin{sol}
        Observe that the elements of $G_i$ consists of permutations on the $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\} - \set i$ which has $n - 1$ elements. Then $G_i \cong S_{n - 1}$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Use Lagrange's Theorem in the multiplicative group $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^\times$ to prove \textit{Fermat's Little Theorem}: if $p$ is a prime then $a^p \equiv a \bmod p$ for all $a \in \z$.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $p$ be a prime. Note that $\units[p] = \{\bar 1, \bar 2, \ldots, \bar{p - 1}\}$. For any $a \in \z$, then we either have $a \mid p$ or $a \nmid p$. If $a \mid p$, then $a \equiv 0 \bmod p$, hence $a^p \equiv 0 \equiv a \bmod p$. If $a \nmid p$, then $\bar a \in \units[p]$. By Lagrange's Theorem and Corollary 3.9, $\abs{\bar a}$ divides $\abs{\units[p]} = p - 1$, hence $\bar a^{p - 1} = \bar 1$. Then $a^{p - 1} \equiv 1 \bmod p$, or $a^p \equiv a \bmod p$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $p$ be a prime and let $n$ be a positive integer. Find the order of $\bar p$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/(p^n - 1)\mathbb{Z})^\times$ and deduce that $n \mid \phi(p^n - 1)$ (here $\phi$ is Euler's function).
    \begin{sol}
        Since $p^n \equiv 1 \bmod (p^n - 1)$, then $\abs{\bar p} \leq n$. Suppose $d < n$ such that $p^d \equiv 1 \bmod (p^n - 1)$. Then $p^n - 1 \mid p^d - 1$ so that $p^n - 1 \leq p^d - 1$, a contradiction. It follows that $\abs{\bar p} = n$. By Lagrange's Theorem, $\abs{\bar p} = n$ divides $\abs{\units[p^n - 1]} = \phi(p^n - 1)$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $G$ be a finite group, let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and let $N \nsub G$. Prove that if $\abs H$ and $|G : N|$ are relatively prime then $H \leq N$.
    \begin{sol}
        Since $N \nsub G$, then $HN \leq G$. Moreover, $H \cap N \leq H$ so that $|H \cap N|$ divides $\abs H$. Then we have that $|G| = m|HN|$ and $|H| = n|H \cap N|$ for some $m, n \in \z$. By Corollary 13, we have that
        \[|HN| = \frac{\abs H \abs N}{|H \cap N|} \implies m|HN| = m\frac{n|H \cap N||N|}{|H \cap N|} \implies \frac{|G|}{|N|} = |G : N| = mn\]
        Since $(\abs H, |G : N|) = 1$, then $n = 1$ so that $\abs H = |H \cap N|$. It follows that $H = H \cap N$, hence $H \leq N$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove that if $N$ is a normal subgroup of the finite group $G$ and $(|N|, |G : N|) = 1$ then $N$ is the unique subgroup of $G$ of order $|N|$.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $M$ be a subgroup of $G$ with order $\abs N$. By the previous exercise, we have $M \leq N$, and since they have the same order, then $M = N$.
    \end{sol}
    \item If $A$ is an abelian group with $A \nsub G$ and $B$ is any subgroup of $G$ prove that $A \cap B \nsub AB$.
    \begin{sol}
        Suppose $y = abxb\inv a\inv \in ab(A \cap B)b\inv a\inv$ for some $x \in A \cap B$. Since $A \nsub G$, then $bxb\inv \in A$ so that $y = a(bxb\inv)a\inv = bxb\inv \in A$. Moreover, $bxb\inv \in B$ since $x \in B$, hence $y \in A \cap B$. It follows that $ab(A \cap B)b\inv a\inv \subseteq A \cap B$, so that $A \cap B \nsub AB$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove that $\mathbb{Q}$ has no proper subgroups of finite index. Deduce that $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ has no proper subgroups of finite index. [Recall \hyperref[ex1.6.21]{Exercise 1.6.21} and \hyperref[ex3.1.15]{Exercise 3.1.15}.]
    \begin{sol}
        Suppose $\q$ has a proper subgroup $H$ such that $|\q : H|$ is some finite $n$. Recalling that $\q$ is divisible by \hyperref[ex2.4.19]{Exercise 2.4.19}, then $\q/H$ is also divisible by \hyperref[ex3.1.15]{Exercise 3.1.15}. However, $\q/H$ is a finite group of order $n$, hence it cannot be divisible unless it is trivial. It follows that $H = \q$, a contradiction. Therefore, $\q$ has no proper subgroups of finite index. Moreover, $\q/\z$ has no proper subgroup of finite index for the same reasoning.
    \end{sol}
    \item Use Lagrange's Theorem in the multiplicative group $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$ to prove \textit{Euler's Theorem}: $a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \bmod n$ for every integer $a$ relatively prime to $n$, where $\varphi$ denotes Euler's $\varphi$-function.
    \begin{sol}
        Recall $\abs{\units} = \phi(n)$. Since $\bar a \in \units$, then $\abs{\bar a}$ divides $\phi(n)$, hence $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \bmod n$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Determine the last two digits of $3^{3^{100}}$. [Determine $3^{100} \bmod \phi(100)$ and use the previous exercise.]
    \begin{sol}
        Note that $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, then $\phi(100) = 2^1(2 - 1)5^1(5 - 1) = 40$. Since $3^4 \bmod 40 = 81 \bmod 40 \equiv 1 \bmod 40$, then $3^{100} \bmod 40 \equiv 1 \bmod 40$. It follows that $3^{100} = 1 + 40k = 1 + \phi(100)k$ for some $k \in \z$, hence
        \[3^{3^{100}} = 3^{1 + \phi(100)k} = 3 \cdot 3^{{\phi(100)}^k} \equiv 3 \cdot 1^k \bmod 100 = 3 \bmod 100\]
        so that the last two digits of $3^{3^{100}}$ are 03.

\subsection{The Isomorphism Theorems}

Let $G$ be a group.

\begin{problems}
    \item Let $F$ be a finite field of order $q$ and let $n \in \zp$. Prove that $|\gl_N(F) : \speclin_n(F)| = q - 1$. [See \hyperref[ex3.1.35]{Exercise 3.1.35}.]
    \begin{sol}
        In \hyperref[ex3.1.35]{Exercise 3.1.35}, we showed that $\speclin_n(F) \nsub \gl_n(F)$ and that $\gl_n(F)/\speclin_n(F) \cong F\unt$. Since $F$ is a finite field of order $q$, then $\abs{F\unt} = q - 1$. We then have that $|\gl_n(F) : \speclin_n(F)| = \abs{F\unt} = q - 1$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove all parts of the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $\ac = \set{A \leq G \mid N \subseteq A}$ and $\bar{\ac} = \set{\bar A \leq \bar G}$. Define the map $\phi : \ac \to \bar{\ac}$ by $\phi(A) = \bar A = A/N$. Note that $\phi(A) \leq \bar G$ as follows: since $\bar 1 \in \bar A$, then $\bar A$ is nonempty. Moreover, for any $\bar a, \bar b \in \bar A$ where $a, b \in A$, then $ab\inv \in A$ implies $\bar a \bar b\inv = \overline{ab\inv} \in \bar A$, hence $\bar A \leq \bar G$. This also implies that $\phi$ is surjective, since for any $\bar A \in \bar{\ac}$, we know that the preimage of $\bar A$ under the natural projection homomorphism from $G$ to $G/N$ is some subgroup $A$ of $G$ containing $N$ such that $\phi(A) = \bar A$. Lastly, suppose $\phi(A) = \phi(B)$ for some $A, B \in \ac$. Then $\bar A = \bar B$ implies that for some $a \in A$, there is some $b \in B$ such that $\bar a = \bar b$, hence $aN = bN$ so that $b\inv a \in N \subseteq B$. It follows that $a = b(b\inv a) \in B$, hence $A \subseteq B$. A similar argument shows that $B \subseteq A$, hence $A = B$ so that $\phi$ is injective. Therefore, $\phi$ is a bijection.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \rightimp Suppose $A \leq B$ for $A, B \in \ac$, and suppose $\bar a \in \bar A$ for some $a \in A$. Since $A \leq B$, then $a \in B$ so that $\bar a \in \bar B$, hence $\bar A \leq \bar B$.
            
            \noindent \leftimp Suppose $\bar A \leq \bar B$ for $A, B \in \ac$, and suppose $a \in A$ for some $a \in A$. Then $\bar a \in \bar A$ so that $\bar a \in \bar B$, hence there is some $b \in B$ such that $\bar a = \bar b$. It follows that $aN = bN$ so that $b\inv a \in N \subseteq B$, hence $a = b(b\inv a) \in B$. Therefore, $A \leq B$.
            \item Consider a mapping $\psi : B/A \to \bar B / \bar A$ given by $\psi(bA) = \bar b \bar A$ for $b \in B$. To show $\psi$ is well-defined, suppose $b_1A = b_2A$ for some $b_1, b_2 \in B$. Then $b_2\inv b_1 \in A$, hence $\overline{b_2\inv b_1} \in \bar A$ so that $\bar b_1 \bar A = \bar b_2 \bar A$, hence $\psi(b_1A) = \psi(b_2A)$. It is clear that $\psi$ is a homomorphism, and it is surjective since for any $\bar b \bar A \in \bar B / \bar A$, there is some $b \in B$ such that $\psi(bA) = \bar b \bar A$. Finally, if $bA \in \ker\psi$, then $\psi(bA) = \bar A$ so that $\bar b \in \bar A$, hence $bN \in A/N$ or that $b \in A$. It follows that $\ker\psi = A/A = 1$, hence $\psi$ is an isomorphism. Therefore, $|B : A| = |B/A| = |\bar B / \bar A| = |\bar B : \bar A|$.
            \item $\bar x \in \bar{\gen{A, B}}$ if and only if $x = x_1x_2 \ldots x_n$ where $x_i \in A \cup B$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n$ if and only if $\bar x = \bar{x_1x_2} \ldots \bar{x_n}$ where $\bar{x_i} \in \bar A \cup \bar B$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n$ if and only if $\bar x \in \gen{\bar A, \bar B}$, hence $\bar{\gen{A, B}} = \gen{\bar A, \bar B}$.
            \item $\bar x \in \bar{A \cap B}$ if and only if $x \in A \cap B$ if and only if $x \in A$ and $x \in B$ if and only if $\bar x \in \bar A$ and $\bar x \in \bar B$ if and only if $\bar x \in \bar A \cap \bar B$, hence $\bar{A \cap B} = \bar A \cap \bar B$.
            \item \rightimp Suppose $A \nsub G$, and let $gN \in \bar G$. Then for any $\bar a \in \bar A$ where $a \in A$, we have that $gag\inv \in A$ so that $gNg\inv = gag\inv N \in \bar A$, hence $\bar A \nsub \bar G$.
            
            \noindent \leftimp Suppose $\bar A \nsub \bar G$, and let $g \in G$. Then for any $a \in A$, we have that $\bar g \bar a \bar g\inv \in \bar A$ so that $gag\inv N \in A/N$, hence $gag\inv \in A$, thus $A \nsub G$. \qh
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove that if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of prime index $p$ then for all $K \leq G$ either
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(i)] $K \leq H$ or
        \item[(ii)] $G = HK$ and $|K : K \cap H| = p$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{sol}
        Since $H \nsub G$, then $N_G(H) = G$. Then $K \leq N_G(H)$, hence $KH \leq G$ by the Second Isomorphism Theorem. By Proposition 3.14, then $KH = HK$. Since we have $H \leq HK \leq G$, we may use \hyperref[ex3.2.11]{Exercise 3.2.11} to conclude that $|G : H| = |G : HK| \cdot |HK : H|$. Since $|G : H| = p$ is prime, we have that $|G : HK|$ is either 1 or $p$. If the former is true, then $G = HK$. If the latter is true, then $HK = H$, hence $K \leq H$. In particular, if the former is true, then $|HK : H| = p$, and we may use the Second Isomorphism Theorem to conclude that $HK/H \cong K/(K \cap H)$ so that $|K : K \cap H| = |HK : H| = p$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $C$ be a normal subgroup of the group $A$ and let $D$ be a normal subgroup of the group $B$. Prove that $(C \times D) \nsub (A \times B)$ and $(A \times B)/(C \times D) \cong (A/C) \times (B/D)$.
    \begin{sol}
        Consider the map $\phi : A \times B \to (A/C) \times (B/D)$ given by $\phi(a, b) = (aC, bD)$. This map is clearly well-defined and a homomorphism. Now suppose $\phi((a, b)) = (C, D)$. Then $aC = C$ and $bD = D$, hence $a \in C$ and $b \in D$, so that $(a, b) \in C \times D$, hence $\ker\phi \subseteq C \times D$. If $(c, d) \in C \times D$, then $\phi((c, d)) = (cC, dD) = (C, D)$, so that $C \times D \subseteq \ker\phi$. It follows that $\ker\phi = C \times D$, hence $C \times D \nsub A \times B$. Lastly, $\phi$ is clearly surjective since for any $(aC, bD) \in (A/C) \times (B/D)$, we have $\phi((a, b)) = (aC, bD)$. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have $(A \times B)/(C \times D) \cong (A/C) \times (B/D)$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $QD_{16} = \gen{\sigma, \tau}$ be the quasidihedral group of order 16 in \hyperref[ex2.5.11]{Exercise 2.5.11}. Prove that $\gen{\sigma^4}$ is normal in $QD_{16}$ and use the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem to draw the lattice of subgroups of $QD_{16}/\gen{\sigma^4}$. Which group of order 8 has the same lattice as this quotient? Use generators and relations for $QD_{16}$ to decide the isomorphism type of this group.
    \begin{sol}
        Note that $\tau\sigma^4\tau = \tau\tau\sigma^{12} = \sigma^4$, hence $\gen{\sigma^4} \nsub QD_{16}$. By the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem, we may draw the following diagram:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
                \node (d8) at (0, 0) {$QD_{16}/\gen{\sigma^4}$};

                \draw (1) -- (r3s) -- (rsr2);
                \draw (r2) -- (r) -- (d8);
                \draw (r2) -- (sr2);
                \draw (r2) -- (rsr2);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        Moreover, $\bar{\sigma^4} = \bar{\tau^2} = \bar 1$ and $\bar{\tau\sigma} = \bar{\sigma^3\tau} = \bar{\sigma\inv\tau}$, then the generators $\bar\sigma$ and $\bar\tau$ satisfy the relations as $r$ and $s$ do in $D_8$, hence $QD_{16}/\gen{\sigma^4} \cong D_8$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $M = \gen{u, v}$ be the modular group of order 16 in \hyperref[ex2.5.14]{Exercise 2.5.14}. Prove that $\gen{v^4}$ is normal in $M$ and use the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem to draw the lattice of subgroups of $M/\gen{v^4}$. Which group of order 8 has the same lattice as this quotient? Use generators and relations for $M$ to decide the isomorphism type of this group.
    \begin{sol}
        Note that $uv^4u = uuv^{20} = v^4$, hence $\gen{v^4} \nsub M$. By the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem, we may draw the following diagram:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style=on grid]
                \node (G) {$M/\gen{v^4}$};

                \node (y) [below left=of G] {$\bar{\gen v}$};
                \node (xy) [below=of G] {$\bar{\gen{uv}}$};
                \node (x y2) [below right=of G] {$\bar{\gen{u, v^2}}$};

                \node (y2) [below right=of y] {$\bar{\gen{v^2}}$};
                \node (xy2) [below=of x y2] {$\bar{\gen{uv^2}}$};
                \node (x y4) [below right=of x y2] {$\bar{\gen{u, v^4}}$};

                \node (y4) [below right=of y2] {$\bar{\gen{v^4}}$};

                \draw (y4) -- (y2) -- (y) -- (G);
                \draw (y4) -- (x y4) -- (x y2) -- (G);
                \draw (y4) -- (xy2) -- (x y2);
                \draw (y2) -- (xy) -- (G);
                \draw (y2) -- (x y2);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        Moreover, $\bar{v^4} = \bar{u^2} = \bar 1$ and $\bar{vu} = \bar{uv^5} = \bar{uv}$ so that the generators of $M/\gen{v^4}$ satisfy the relations as $a$ and $b$ do in $Z_2 \times Z_4$, whose presentation is given in \hyperref[ex2.5.12]{Exercise 2.5.12}. Then $M/\gen{v^4} \cong Z_2 \times Z_4$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $M$ and $N$ be normal subgroups of $G$ such that $G = MN$. Prove that $G/(M \cap N) \cong (G/M) \times (G/N)$. [Draw the lattice.]
    \begin{sol}
        The lattice is given as the following, where double lines represent the quotient group $G/(M \cap N)$:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
                \node (MN) at (0, 0) {$G = MN$};
                \node (M) at (-1, -1) {$M$};
                \node (N) at (1, -1) {$N$};
                \node (MnN) at (0, -2) {$M \cap N$};
                \node (1) at (0, -3) {1};

                \draw (1) -- (MnN);
                \draw [double] (MnN) -- (M) -- (MN);
                \draw [double] (MnN) -- (N) -- (MN);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        Now consider the mapping $\phi : G \to (G/M) \times (G/N)$ given by $\phi(g) = (gM, gN)$. This is clearly a homomorphism with $\ker\phi = M \cap N$. Now let $(gM, hN) \in (G/M) \times (G/N)$. Since $G = MN$, there exist $m, m' \in M$ and $n, n' \in N$ such that $g = mn$ and $h = m'n'$. Then $\phi(mn') = (mnM, mn'N) = (gM, hN)$, hence $\phi$ is surjective. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have $G/(M \cap N) \cong \phi(G) = (G/M) \times (G/N)$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $p$ be a prime and let $G$ be the group of $p$-power roots  of $1$ in $\c$ (cf. \hyperref[ex2.4.18]{Exercise 2.4.18}). Prove that the map $z \mapsto z^p$ is a surjective homomorphism. Deduce that $G$ is isomorphic to a proper quotient of itself.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $\phi(z) = z^p$ be the map. For any $z, w \in G$, then $\phi(zw) = (zw)^p = z^p w^p = \phi(z)\phi(w)$, hence $\phi$ is a homomorphism. Moreover, for any $y \in G$, there is some $n \in \zp$ such that $y^{p^n} = 1$. Then let $z = y^{p^{n - 1}}$, so that $z^p = y^{p^n} = 1$, hence $z \in G$ and $\phi(z) = y$. It follows that $\phi$ is surjective. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have $G/\ker\phi \cong G$. Since $\ker\phi$ contains all $p$-power roots of unity of order dividing $p$, then $\ker\phi$ is nontrivial, hence $G$ is isomorphic to a proper quotient of itself.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $p$ be a prime and let $G$ be a group of order $p^am$, where $p$ does not divide $m$. Assume $P$ is a subgroup of $G$ of order $p^a$ and $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order $p^b n$, where $p$ does not divide $n$. Prove that $|P \cap N| = p^b$ and $|PN/N| = p^{a - b}$. (The subgroup $P$ of $G$ is called a \textit{Sylow $p$-subgroup} of $G$. This exercise shows that the intersection of any Sylow $p$-subgroup with a normal subgroup $N$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N$.)
    \begin{sol}
        Since $P \cap N \leq P$, Lagrange's Theorem concludes that $|P \cap N| = p^c$ for some $c \leq a$. Moreover, $c \leq b$ since $P \cap N \leq N$ where $\abs N = p^b n$ where $p \nmid n$. Since $N \nsub G$, then $P \leq N_G(N) = G$ so that by the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we have $PN \leq G$, and $PN/N \cong P/(P \cap N)$. It now follows that $|PN/N| = |P/P \cap N| = p^{a - k}$.

        Now note that $\abs{G/N} = \abs G/\abs N = p^{a - b}m/n$, where $p \nmid m$ and $p \nmid n$. Since $PN/N \leq G/N$, then we may use Lagrange's Theorem again to conclude that $p^{a - k} \mid p^{a - b}$, hence $a - k \leq a - b$, or $k \geq b$. Since we showed previously that $k \leq b$, it follows that $k = b$, hence $|P \cap N| = p^b$ and $|PN/N| = p^{a - b}$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Generalize the preceding exercise as follows. A subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$ is called a \textit{Hall subgroup} of $G$ if its index in $G$ is relatively prime to its order: $(|G : H|, |H|) = 1$. Prove that if $H$ is a Hall subgroup of $G$ and $N \nsub G$, then $H \cap N$ is a Hall subgroup of $N$ and $HN/N$ is a Hall subgroup of $G/N$.
    \begin{sol}
        It follows by the Second Isomorphism Theorem that $HN \leq G$ and $HN/N \cong H/(H \cap N)$. Note that
        \[|HN| = \frac{\abs H \abs N}{\abs{H \cap N}} \quad \text{must divide} \quad \abs G = \abs H |G : H|\]
        Hence, $|N|/\abs{H \cap N}$ divides $|G : H|$. Since $(|G : H|, \abs H) = 1$, and $|N|/|H \cap N|$ divides $|G : H|$, it follows that $(|N|/\abs{H \cap N}, \abs H) = 1$, hence $(\abs{N : H \cap N}, \abs{H \cap N}) = 1$. Then $H \cap N$ is a Hall subgroup of $N$.

        Now, observe that $|G/N : HN/N| = |G|/|HN| = |G:H|/|HN : H|$. Moreover, $|HN/N| = |H|/|H \cap N|$. Then $(|G/N : HN/N|, |HN/N|) = 1$ follows because $(|G : H|, \abs H) = 1$, hence $HN/N$ is a Hall subgroup of $G/N$.

\subsection{Composition Series and the H\"older Program}

\begin{problems}

    \item Prove that if $G$ is an abelian simple group then $G \cong \mathbb{Z}_p$ for some prime $p$ (do not assume $G$ is a finite group).
    \begin{sol}
        Since $G$ is simple, then its only subgroups are 1 and $G$. Since $G$ is abelian, then all of its subgroups are normal. If $G$ is trivial, then $G \cong Z_1$, which we exclude from this statement.
        
        Consider now some nonidentity $g \in G$. Then $\gen g \leq G$. Since $g \neq 1$, and $G$ is simple, it must be that $\gen g = G$, hence $G$ is cyclic.

        Now consider $\abs g = n$. If $n = \infty$, then $\gen{g^k}$ is a proper nontrivial subgroup of $G$ for any $k \in \zp$, contradicting that $G$ is simple. Then $n$ must be finite. If $n = ab$ for $a, b \in \zp$ where $1 < a, b < n$, then $\gen{g^a}$ is a proper nontrivial subgroup of $G$, again contradicting that $G$ is simple. It follows that $n$ is prime, hence $G \cong Z_n$ for some prime $n$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Exhibit all $3$ composition series for $Q_8$ and all $7$ composition series for $D_8$. List the composition factors in each case.
    \begin{sol}
        The composition series for $Q_8$ are as follows:
        \begin{align*}
            1 & \nsub \gen{-1} \nsub \gen i \nsub Q_8 \\
            1 & \nsub \gen{-1} \nsub \gen j \nsub Q_8 \\
            1 & \nsub \gen{-1} \nsub \gen k \nsub Q_8
        \end{align*}
        The composition factors for each series are isomorphic to $Z_2$.

        The composition series for $D_8$ are as follows:
        \begin{align*}
            1 & \nsub \gen s \nsub \gen{s, r^2} \nsub D_8 \\
            1 & \nsub \gen{r^2s} \nsub \gen{s, r^2} \nsub D_8 \\
            1 & \nsub \gen{r^2} \nsub \gen{s, r^2} \nsub D_8 \\
            1 & \nsub \gen{r^2} \nsub \gen r \nsub D_8 \\
            1 & \nsub \gen{r^2} \nsub \gen{rs, r^2} \nsub D_8 \\
            1 & \nsub \gen{rs} \nsub \gen{rs, r^2} \nsub D_8 \\
            1 & \nsub \gen{r^3s} \nsub \gen{rs, r^2} \nsub D_8
        \end{align*}
        with each composition factor isomorphic to $Z_2$.
    \end{sol}
    \item Find a composition series for the quasidihedral group of order $16$
    (cf. \hyperref[ex2.5.11]{Exercise 2.5.11}). Deduce that $QD_{16}$ is solvable.
    \begin{sol}
        A clear composition series is $1 \nsub \gen{\sigma^4} \nsub \gen{\sigma^2} \nsub \gen{\sigma} \nsub QD_{16}$, with each composition factor isomorphic to $Z_2$. Since all composition factors are abelian, then $QD_{16}$ is solvable.
    \end{sol}
    \item Use Cauchy's Theorem and induction to show that a finite abelian group has a subgroup of order $n$ for each positive divisor $n$ of its order.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $\abs G = m$. If $m = 1$, the result is trivial. If $m$ is prime, then the result is trivial by Cauchy's Theorem.

        Suppose the result is true for all groups with order less than $m$, and let $n \in \zp$ where $n \mid m$. If $n$ is prime, then there exists $g \in G$ where $\abs g = n$ by Cauchy's Theorem. Then $\abs g \leq G$ is a subgroup of order $n$, and the result is true. Suppose now $n$ is not prime. Then $n = kp$ for some prime divisor $p$ of $n$. Since $p \mid m$, there exists an element $h \in G$ where $\abs h = p$ by Cauchy's Theorem. Then $\gen h$ has order $p$, and $G/\gen h$ is a finite abelian group of order $m/p < m$. Since $k \mid m/p$, by the inductive hypothesis, there exists a subgroup $\bar H$ of $G/\gen h$ where $\abs{\bar H} = k$. By the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem, there exists a subgroup $H$ of $G$ containing $\gen h$ such that $H/\gen h = \bar H$. Then $\abs H = \abs{\bar H} \abs{\gen h} = kp = n$, hence $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ of order $n$. By induction, the result holds for all finite abelian groups.
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove that subgroups and quotient groups of a solvable group are solvable.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $G$ be a solvable group, and let $H \leq G$. Then there exists a chain of subgroups
        \[1 = G_0 \nsub G_1 \nsub \cdots \nsub G_n = G\]
        such that $G_{i + 1}/G_i$ is abelian for each $0 \leq i \leq n - 1$. Consider the set of subgroups $H_i = H \cap G_i$ for each $0 \leq i \leq n$. Note that $H_0 = H \cap G_0 = 1$ and $H_n = H \cap G_n = H$ since $H \leq G$. It is clear that $H_i \leq H_{i + 1}$ for each $0 \leq i \leq n - 1$. Moreover, let $g \in H_{i + 1}$ and $x \in H_i$. Then $g \in G_{i + 1}$ and $x \in G_i$. Since $G_i \nsub G_{i + 1}$, then $gxg\inv \in G_i$. Moreover, $g, x \in H$ so that $gxg\inv \in H$, hence $gxg\inv \in H_i$. It follows that $H_i \nsub H_{i + 1}$ for each $0 \leq i \leq n - 1$. Note that $H_i = G_i \cap H = (G_i \cap G_{i + 1}) \cap H = G_i \cap H_{i + 1}$ so that by the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we have $H_{i + 1}/H_i = H_{i + 1}/(H_{i + 1} \cap G_i) \cong H_{i + 1}G_i/G_i \leq G_{i + 1}/G_i$. Since $G_{i + 1}/G_i$ is abelian, then so is $H_{i + 1}/H_i$. Therefore, $H$ is solvable with the chain
        \[1 = H_0 \nsub H_1 \nsub \cdots \nsub H_n = H\]
        Now let $N \nsub G$. Consider the subgroups $N_i = G_iN$. Since it is clear that $N_i \leq N_{i + 1}$, we need to show that $N_i \nsub N_{i + 1}$. To that end, let $gn \in N_{i + 1}$ and $hn' \in N_i$ for some $g \in G_{i + 1}$, $h \in G_i$, and $n, n' \in N$. We now consider the element $gnhn'n\inv g\inv \in gnN_i(gn)\inv$. Since $h \in G_i \leq G$, then $nh = hn''$ for some $n'' \in N$, hence $gnhn'n\inv g\inv = ghn''n'n\inv g\inv$. Moreover, $(n''n'n\inv)g\inv = g\inv n'''$ for $n''' \in N$ so we obtain $ghg\inv n''' \in N_i$ since $ghg\inv \in G_i$ because $G_i \nsub G_{i + 1}$. It follows that $N_i \nsub N_{i + 1}$. By the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem, then $N_i/N \nsub N_{i + 1}/N$, and the Third Isomorphism Theorem concludes that $(N_{i + 1}/N)/(N_i/N) \cong N_{i + 1}/N_i$. 

        We now show $N_{i + 1}/N_i$ is abelian. Let $g_1n_1N_i, g_2n_2N_i \in N_{i + 1}/N_i$ for some $g_1, g_2 \in G_{i + 1}$ and $n_1, n_2 \in N$, and consider the product $(g_1n_1N_i)(g_2n_2N_i) = g_1g_2N_i$, where $g_1n_1g_2n_2 = g_1g_2n_3$ for some $n_3 \in N$ since $N \nsub G$. Since $G_{i + 1}/G_i$ is abelian, then $(g_1G_i)(g_2G_i) = (g_2G_i)(g_1G_i)$, which implies $g_1g_2g_1 = g_2g_1h$ for some $h \in G_i \leq N_i$. Hence, $g_1g_2N_i = g_2g_1hN_i = g_2g_1N_i$ so that $N_{i + 1}/N_i$ is abelian. Therefore, $G/N$ is solvable with the chain
        \[1 = N_0/N \nsub N_1/N \nsub \cdots \nsub N_n/N = G/N \qh\]
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove part (1) of the Jordan--H\"older Theorem by induction on $|G|$.
    \begin{sol}
        Let $G$ be a finite group. If $G = 1$, then the result is trivial. Suppose now $G$ is nontrivial and that the result holds for all groups of order less than $\abs G$. If $G$ is simple, then the composition series is $1 \nsub G$. Suppose now $G$ is not simple, and let $N$ be a maximal, normal subgroup of $G$. Since $\abs N < \abs G$, we may conclude by the inductive hypothesis that there exists a composition series
        \[1 = N_0 \nsub N_1 \nsub \cdots \nsub N_k = N\]
        for some $k \in \zp$. Since $N \nsub G$ and $G/N$ is simple, then the chain
        \[1 = N_0 \nsub N_1 \nsub \cdots \nsub N_k = N \nsub G\]
        is a composition series for $G$. By induction, the result holds for all finite groups.
    \end{sol}
    \item If $G$ is a finite group and $H \trianglelefteq G$, prove that there is a composition series of $G$, one of whose terms is $H$.
    \begin{sol}
        If $H = G$, then the result follows trivially, since the last term in the composition series must be $H$. Now suppose $H$ is a proper, normal subgroup of $G$. If $\abs G = 1$, the result is trivial. Suppose $\abs G > 1$, and assume the result is true for all groups with order less than $\abs G$.

        Since $H$ is proper, then $\abs H < \abs G$, hence we have a composition series
        \[1 = H_0 \nsub H_1 \nsub \cdots \nsub H_m = H\]
        by the inductive hypothesis. Now consider the quotient group $G/H$. Since $\abs{G/H} < \abs G$, then by the inductive hypothesis, there exists a composition series
        \[1 = K_0/H \nsub K_1/H \nsub \cdots \nsub K_n/H = G/H\]
        for some $n \in \zp$. By the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem, we have $H = K_0 \nsub K_1 \nsub \cdots \nsub K_n = G$. Since each $K_{i + 1}/K_i \cong (K_{i + 1}/H)/(K_i/H)$ is simple, then the chain
        \[1 = H_0 \nsub H_1 \nsub \cdots \nsub H_m = H = K_0 \nsub K_1 \nsub \cdots \nsub K_n = G\]
        is a composition series for $G$ with one of its terms equal to $H$. By induction, the result holds for all finite groups.
    \end{sol}
    \item Let $G$ be a \textit{finite} group. Prove that the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] $G$ is solvable.
    \item[(ii)] $G$ has a chain of subgroups
    \[1 = H_0 \trianglelefteq H_1 \trianglelefteq H_2 \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq H_s = G\]
    such that $H_{i+1}/H_i$ is cyclic, $0 \le i \le s-1$.
    \item[(iii)] All composition factors of $G$ are of prime order.
    \item[(iv)] $G$ has a chain of subgroups
    \[1 = N_0 \trianglelefteq N_1 \trianglelefteq N_2 \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq N_t = G\]
    such that each $N_i$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and $N_{i+1}/N_i$ is abelian,
    $0 \le i \le t-1$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \noindent [For (iv), prove that a minimal nontrivial normal subgroup $M$ of $G$ is necessarily abelian and then use induction. To see that $M$ is abelian, let $N \trianglelefteq M$ be of prime index (by (iii)) and show that $x^{-1}y^{-1}xy \in N$ for all $x,y \in M$ (cf. \hyperref[ex3.1.40]{Exercise 3.1.40}). Apply the same argument to $gNg^{-1}$ to show that $x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$ lies in the intersection of all $G$-conjugates of $N$, and use the minimality of $M$ to conclude that $x^{-1}y^{-1}xy = 1$.]
    \begin{sol}
        (i) \rightimp (ii): Suppose $G$ is solvable. 
    \end{sol}
    \item Prove the following special case of part (2) of the Jordan--H\"older Theorem:
    assume the finite group $G$ has two composition series
    \[
    1 = N_0 \trianglelefteq N_1 \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq N_r = G
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    1 = M_0 \trianglelefteq M_1 \trianglelefteq M_2 = G.
    \]
    Show that $r = 2$ and that the list of composition factors is the same.
    [Use the Second Isomorphism Theorem.]

    \item Prove part (2) of the Jordan--H\"older Theorem by induction on $\min\{r,s\}$.
    [Apply the inductive hypothesis to $H = N_{r-1} \cap M_{s-1}$ and use the preceding exercises.]

    \item Prove that if $H$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of the solvable group $G$ then there is
    a nontrivial subgroup $A$ of $H$ with $A \trianglelefteq G$ and $A$ abelian.

    \item Prove (without using the Feit--Thompson Theorem) that the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Every group of odd order is solvable.
    \item[(ii)] The only simple groups of odd order are those of prime order.
    \end{enumerate}
